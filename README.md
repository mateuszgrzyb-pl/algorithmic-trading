This repository contains my personal project focused on building a **full machine learning pipeline** for forecasting quarterly stock returns of S\&P 500 companies. **The project highlights clean architecture, reproducibility, and best practices** in applied machine learning for quantitative finance.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Financial datasets used in this project are **not published here** due to licensing and storage considerations. The code and methodology are fully open, allowing replication with your own API keys and data access.

This repository uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for continuous integration.  
Every commit and pull request automatically triggers unit tests to ensure correctness and stability of the codebase.

## Overview

* **Universe:** S\&P 500 companies (1985‚Äì2024)
* **Task:** Regression problem ‚Äì forecasting % quarterly returns
* **Strategy:** Each quarter, the pipeline ranks stocks by predicted return and simulates investment in the top candidate(s)
* **Target Labeling:** Inspired by *Triple-Barrier Method* (first introduced by L√≥pez de Prado)
* **Features:** Wide set of fundamental indicators (valuation, profitability, growth, liquidity, leverage)
* **Pipeline Stages:**

  1. Data ingestion (FinanceToolkit API)
  2. Preprocessing & validation
  3. Feature engineering
  4. Target construction
  5. Modeling (ML regressors)
  6. Backtesting & evaluation

---

## Key Highlights

* **Stage-based modular architecture** ‚Äì each pipeline step is self-contained and reusable
* **Configuration-driven design** ‚Äì YAML/JSON for features, dates, parameters
* **Unit testing and logging** for reliability
* **Clean, production-level code style** (PEP8, black, flake8)
* **Extendable** ‚Äì can easily be connected to APIs or other ML workflows

---

## Results (to be added)

* üìà **Backtest performance (XIRR, Sharpe ratio, drawdowns)**
* üîç **Feature importance & SHAP analysis**
* üìä **Equity curve plots, correlation matrices, distribution charts**

(Placeholders for visuals ‚Äì will be updated with charts and metrics.)

## Related Work

* [sp500-selector](https://github.com/mateuszgrzyb-pl/sp500-selector) ‚Äì companion project focused on **deployment** of the trained model with **FastAPI** and **Azure integration**.

## Future Directions

* Adding alternative datasets (sentiment, macroeconomic indicators)
* Extended risk-adjusted performance metrics
* Real-time data streaming and API serving
* Advanced model explainability
